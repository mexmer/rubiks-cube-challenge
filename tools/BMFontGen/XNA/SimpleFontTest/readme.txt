SimpleFontTest README

A basic test of the BitmapFont class in the XNA framework.

The \Build directory contains the pre-build executable and the
required support files (the fonts).

When you build your own version, you will need to either:
(1) Copy the PNG and XML files from the \Build directory into the same
    directory as your executable
or
(2) Set the \Build directory as your working directory
